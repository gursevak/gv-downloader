# GV Downloader

This is a really simple bash shell script that I made to quickly download katha from [gurmatveechar.com], but it can be used on any site that lets you download playlist files.

# Usage

1. Download or clone the repository and replace the provided `.m3u` file with the `playlist.m3u` file that has the tracks you want to download. Playlist files can usually be downloaded from katha/keertan websites: navigate to the folder or playlist that you want to download and look for the green 'play button' icon at the top of the folder

2. Open the `download.sh` file using `Terminal.app` or your bash terminal of choice (right-click > Open As)

3. Follow the prompts and start downloading. You can quit the program at any time by pressing `CTR+C` (^+C) on your keyboard at any time. When you restart, the program will automatically begin with the file that you left off at (and remove downloaded files from `playlist.m3u`). Enjoy!
